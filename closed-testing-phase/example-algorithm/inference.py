"""
The following is a simple example algorithm.

It is meant to run within a container.

To run the container locally, you can call the following bash script:

  ./do_test_run.sh

This will start the inference and reads from ./test/input and writes to ./test/output

To save the container and prep it for upload to Grand-Challenge.org you can call:

  ./do_save.sh

Any container that shows the same behaviour will do, this is purely an example of how one COULD do it.

Reference the documentation to get details on the runtime environment on the platform:
https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/runtime-environment/

Happy programming!
